# MG/SAIC CUSTOM INTEGRATION

**Important Notes:** 
- **Using this integration causes the MG/SAIC mobile app to shut down, as per API requirements, since only one device can be connected at a time. Logging into the mobile app causes this integration to disconnect and fail to set up.**
- This Integration has only been tested on a MG Marvel R model. Please provide feedback on sensors and information for other vehicles.

## INSTALLATION

### HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)

1. Ensure that HACS is installed.
2. Go to HACS
3. On the top right menu select "Custom repositories"

6. Search for "MG SAIC" and download the repository.
7. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [MG SAIC Custom Integration GitHub repository](#).
2. Unzip the release and copy the `mg_saic` directory to `custom_components` in your Home Assistant configuration directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

## CONFIGURATION

[<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36459daa-a780-448a-82a5-19ee07ccd3f6">](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=mg_saic)


1. Go to Configuration -> Integrations.
2. Click on the "+ Add Integration" button.
3. Search for "MG SAIC" and follow the instructions to set up the integration.
4. Select your type of account (email or phone), enter the details and select your region (EU, Asia, China)
5. Once connected to the API, a list of available VINs associated with your account will be shown. Select the vehicle that you want to integrate and finish the process.

You may add additional vehicles by following the same steps as above.

## Version History
```
0.1.2
- Refactor code to work with data coordinator
- Revised mechanics for connection with API and data retrieval
- Update saic-python-client-ng requirements to version 0.2.3
- Added new sensors for charging data
- Renamed and revised sensor data and info
- Revise config_flow to allow login with phone and email
- Initial implementation of services (some services still not available, but are implemented as a proof of concept). _Feedback on this will be helpful_
- Change update interval to 5 minutes once charging is detected
- Refactor API responses and values as needed. Charging sensors only display data if Charging is Active, otherwise 0 will be displayed
- Fuel Level, Fuel Range, EV State of Charge and Electric Range are vehicle dependent. Add logic to determine the vehicle type and show sensors accordingly.
